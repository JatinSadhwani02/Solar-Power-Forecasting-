# Solar-Power-Forecasting-
 In recent years, the rapid boost of variable energy generations particularly from wind and solar energy resources in the power grid has led to these generations becoming a noteworthy source of uncertainty with load behaviour still being the main source of variability.

 Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power systems.

 The main crucial and challenging issue in solar power production is the intermittency of power generation due to weather conditions. In particular, a variation of the temperature and irradiance can have a profound impact on the quality of electric power production.

 Solar power forecasting basically is predicting the solar generation for future time blocks based on forecasted weather parameters like irradiance, ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed and other relevant parameters.
